# Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs

### Foreword

#### pyramidal v organic languages

strongly typed, structured + monolithic programs  
vs  
weakly/dynamically typed, reusable functions

> Pascal is for building pyramids ­ imposing, breathtaking, static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place. Lisp is for building organisms ­imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place.  
>
> As a result the pyramid must stand unchanged for a millennium; the organism must evolve or perish.

### 1. Building Abstractions with Procedures

#### computers and magic

"We conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells ... [Programs] are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform."

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. — Arthur C Clarke

"Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately."
