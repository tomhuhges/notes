# Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs

### Foreword

#### pyramidal v organic languages

strongly typed, structured + monolithic programs  
vs  
weakly/dynamically typed, reusable functions

> Pascal is for building pyramids ­ imposing, breathtaking, static structures built by armies pushing heavy blocks into place. Lisp is for building organisms ­imposing, breathtaking, dynamic structures built by squads fitting fluctuating myriads of simpler organisms into place.  
>
> As a result the pyramid must stand unchanged for a millennium; the organism must evolve or perish.

#### computers and magic

> We conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells ... The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. — SICP

> Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. — Arthur C Clarke
